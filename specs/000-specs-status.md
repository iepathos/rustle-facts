This document tracks the status of all specification documents in the Rustle-Facts project.

## Specification Status Overview

### Completed Specs

| Spec # | Feature | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| - | - | - |

### In Progress / Planned Specs

| Spec # | Feature | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 010 | Architecture Detection Tool | ‚¨ú Planned |
| 020 | Enhanced SSH Configuration | ‚¨ú Planned |

## Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Specification is finalized and implementation is complete
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Currently being implemented
- ‚¨ú **Planned**: Specification written but implementation not started
- üìù **Draft**: Specification is being written or revised

## Spec Numbering Convention

Specs are numbered in increments of 10 to allow for insertions:
- 010, 020, 030... for major features
- 015, 025, 035... for related sub-features if needed

## Notes

- Specifications should be comprehensive enough for implementation without ambiguity
- Each spec should include API design, implementation details, and testing strategy
- Update this file when creating new specs or changing implementation status
