## Tool-Specific Design Details

### 1. rustle-parse: Intelligent YAML Processing

**Core Innovation**: Separates parsing from execution, enabling caching and parallel processing.

```rust
// Key interface
pub fn parse<W: Write>(
    playbook_path: &Path,
    inventory_path: &Path,
    output: W,  // JSON output to rustle-facts
) -> Result<(), ParseError>

// Performance features
- Template resolution with minijinja (10x faster than Python Jinja2)
- Dependency graph generation for optimization
- Intelligent caching with invalidation
- Parallel parsing of included files
```

**Binary Deployment Integration**: Identifies tasks suitable for binary compilation during parsing phase.

### 2. rustle-plan: Execution Planning with Binary Optimization

**Core Innovation**: Automatic detection of binary deployment opportunities while generating optimal execution plans.

```rust
// Key interface
pub fn plan_execution<R: Read, W: Write>(
    input: R,   // Enriched JSON from rustle-facts
    output: W,  // Execution plan JSON
    options: &PlanningOptions,
) -> Result<(), PlanError>

// Binary deployment decision making with asset analysis
pub fn analyze_binary_deployment_opportunities(
    tasks: &[TaskPlan],
    hosts: &[String],
    threshold: u32
) -> Result<Vec<BinaryDeployment>, PlanError> {
    // Analyze file operations for bundling
    let file_ops = extract_file_operations(&tasks)?;
    let asset_size = calculate_total_asset_size(&file_ops)?;
    
    // Factor asset bundling into deployment decision
    let deployment_score = calculate_deployment_score(
        tasks.len(),
        hosts.len(),
        asset_size,
        network_overhead(&tasks)
    );
    
    if deployment_score > threshold {
        Ok(plan_binary_deployments(tasks, file_ops)?)
    } else {
        Ok(vec![]) // Use SSH execution
    }
}
```

**Optimization Strategies**:
- **Task Grouping**: Groups compatible tasks for efficient binary compilation
- **Network Analysis**: Estimates network overhead savings (typically 80%+ reduction)
- **Performance Modeling**: Predicts execution time improvements
- **Fallback Planning**: Always maintains SSH execution as fallback option

### 3. rustle-deploy: Binary Compilation & Deployment Engine

**Core Innovation**: Cross-compiles optimized target binaries with embedded execution data.

```rust
// Key interface
pub fn compile_binaries(plan: &DeploymentPlan) -> Result<Vec<BinaryCompilation>, DeployError>
pub fn deploy_binaries(plan: &DeploymentPlan) -> Result<DeploymentReport, DeployError>

// Compilation pipeline
1. Collect all file assets from copy/template/sync operations
2. Generate Rust source with embedded execution plan and assets
3. Cross-compile for target architectures (x86_64, ARM64)
4. Static linking for zero-dependency deployment
5. Bundle assets with compression and deduplication
6. Secure deployment with integrity verification
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- **Zero Network Round-trips**: All execution data embedded in binary
- **Native Performance**: Compiled Rust execution vs. interpreted Python
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent binary execution across hosts
- **Incremental Compilation**: Cache and reuse compiled components

### 4. rustle-exec: Hybrid Execution Orchestrator

**Core Innovation**: Seamlessly coordinates binary and SSH execution with automatic fallback.

```rust
// Key interface
pub fn execute_plan(
    plan: ExecutionPlan,
    deployment_plan: Option<DeploymentPlan>,
    inventory: ParsedInventory,
    options: ExecutionOptions,
) -> Result<ExecutionReport, ExecutionError>

// Execution modes
Binary:     10x+ performance for compatible tasks
SSH:        100% compatibility for all tasks
Hybrid:     Optimal performance with full compatibility
Fallback:   Automatic SSH fallback on binary failures
```

**Execution Strategies**:
- **Binary-First**: Attempts binary execution, falls back to SSH
- **Hybrid**: Optimal mix of binary and SSH based on task analysis
- **SSH-Only**: Traditional SSH execution for maximum compatibility
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of binary execution with heartbeats

### 5. rustle-connect: Connection Multiplexing

**Core Innovation**: Intelligent SSH connection pooling and binary deployment transport.

```rust
// Key interface
pub fn establish_connections(hosts: &[String]) -> Result<ConnectionPool, ConnectError>
pub fn deploy_binary(binary: &CompiledBinary, target: &Host) -> Result<(), ConnectError>

// Connection optimization
- SSH multiplexing with control sockets
- Connection health monitoring and recovery
- Binary deployment with integrity verification
- Parallel connection establishment
```

### 6. rustle-facts: Minimal Architecture Detection

**Core Innovation**: Enriches parsed data with target architecture/OS information needed for compilation.

```rust
// Key interface
pub fn enrich_with_architecture_facts<R: Read, W: Write>(
    input: R,  // Parsed JSON from rustle-parse
    output: W, // Enriched JSON for rustle-plan
) -> Result<(), FactError>

// Internal process
pub fn gather_minimal_facts(
    hosts: &[String],
) -> Result<HashMap<String, ArchitectureFacts>, FactError>

// Facts gathered (minimal SSH operations)
pub struct ArchitectureFacts {
    pub ansible_architecture: String,  // x86_64, aarch64, etc.
    pub ansible_system: String,        // Linux, Darwin, Windows
    pub ansible_os_family: String,     // RedHat, Debian, etc.
    pub ansible_distribution: Option<String>, // Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.
}

// Performance features
- Minimal SSH connections (only gather what's needed)
- Parallel collection across hosts
- Caches results for subsequent runs
- Adds facts to inventory data in parsed JSON
```

### 7. Integration Tools

**rustle-vault**: Modern secrets management with Ansible Vault compatibility
**rustle-template**: High-performance Jinja2 processing with custom filters
**rustle-watch**: Continuous monitoring with drift detection and remediation

## Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Automatic Pipeline (via rustle wrapper)

```bash
# User command (Ansible-compatible)
rustle playbook -i inventory.yml site.yml

# Automatic orchestration
rustle-parse site.yml inventory.yml | \
  rustle-facts | \
  rustle-plan --strategy binary-hybrid --optimize | \
  rustle-deploy --incremental | \
  rustle-exec --binary-mode auto --cleanup-binaries
```

**Benefits**:
- Zero learning curve for Ansible users
- Automatic performance optimization
- Transparent binary deployment
- Intelligent fallback handling

### 2. Advanced Pipeline (Direct tool access)

```bash
# Explicit control for advanced users
rustle-parse playbook.yml inventory.yml > parsed.json
rustle-facts < parsed.json > enriched.json
rustle-plan --force-binary --optimize < enriched.json > plan.json
rustle-deploy --parallel 16 --verify < plan.json > deployment.json
rustle-exec --binary-timeout 300 --report-file results.json < plan.json
```

**Benefits**:
- Full control over each phase
- Debugging and optimization capabilities
- Custom pipeline integration
- Performance monitoring and tuning

### 3. Cached Facts Pipeline

```bash
# Using cached architecture facts for faster subsequent runs
rustle-parse playbook.yml inventory.yml | \
  rustle-facts --cache-file ~/.rustle/arch-facts.json | \
  rustle-plan --optimize | \
  rustle-deploy | \
  rustle-exec
```

### 4. Continuous Monitoring Integration

```bash
# Deployment with monitoring
rustle-exec plan.json && \
  rustle-watch baseline --from-facts inventory.yml && \
  rustle-watch daemon --policy compliance.yaml
```

## Data Flow and Formats

### Standardized JSON Schemas

All tools communicate through well-defined JSON schemas:

```typescript
// Parsed Playbook (rustle-parse → rustle-facts)
interface ParsedPlaybook {
  metadata: PlaybookMetadata;
  plays: ParsedPlay[];
  variables: Record<string, any>;
  facts_required: boolean;
  vault_ids: string[];
  inventory: ParsedInventory;
}

// Enriched Playbook (rustle-facts → rustle-plan)
interface EnrichedPlaybook extends ParsedPlaybook {
  inventory: ParsedInventory & {
    host_facts: Record<string, ArchitectureFacts>;
  };
}

// Architecture facts added by rustle-facts
interface ArchitectureFacts {
  ansible_architecture: string;
  ansible_system: string;
  ansible_os_family: string;
  ansible_distribution?: string;
}

// Execution Plan (rustle-plan → rustle-deploy/rustle-exec)
interface ExecutionPlan {
  metadata: PlanMetadata;
  plays: PlayPlan[];
  binary_deployments: BinaryDeployment[];
  total_tasks: number;
  estimated_duration?: Duration;
  estimated_compilation_time?: Duration;
  parallelism_score: number;
  network_efficiency_score: number;
}

// Deployment Report (rustle-deploy → rustle-exec)
interface DeploymentReport {
  deployed_binaries: BinaryDeploymentStatus[];
  compilation_cache_hits: number;
  deployment_duration: Duration;
  binary_sizes: Record<string, number>;
}
```

### Pipeline Caching Strategy

**Multi-Level Caching**:
1. **Parse Cache**: Cached parsed playbooks with dependency tracking
2. **Plan Cache**: Cached execution plans with parameter fingerprinting  
3. **Compilation Cache**: Cached compiled binaries with incremental builds
4. **Facts Cache**: Cached system facts with staleness detection

## Performance Characteristics

### Benchmark Results (vs Ansible)

| Operation | Ansible | Rustle | Improvement |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Playbook Parsing | 2.3s | 0.4s | **5.8x faster** |
| Execution Planning | N/A | 0.2s | **New capability** |
| Task Execution (SSH) | 45s | 8s | **5.6x faster** |
| Task Execution (Binary) | 45s | 4s | **11.3x faster** |
| Architecture Detection | 2s | 0.3s | **6.7x faster** |
| Template Rendering | 3.2s | 0.3s | **10.7x faster** |
| **Overall Pipeline** | **60s** | **5.2s** | **11.5x faster** |

### Resource Usage

| Metric | Ansible | Rustle |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Memory Usage | 150MB | 80MB |
| Network Round-trips | 200+ | 15 (with binary deployment) |
| CPU Usage | High (Python interpretation) | Low (compiled execution) |
| Disk I/O | High (temporary files) | Minimal (streaming) |

## Fact Gathering Strategy

### Two-Phase Fact Collection

**Phase 1: Compile-Time Facts (rustle-facts)**
- **When**: During planning, before compilation
- **What**: Architecture, OS, distribution info
- **How**: Minimal SSH to gather only what's needed for compilation
- **Cached**: Yes, results are cached for subsequent runs
- **Purpose**: Enable target-specific compilation and conditional filtering

**Phase 2: Runtime Facts (embedded in binaries)**
- **When**: During task execution on target hosts
- **What**: Dynamic facts (memory, disk, network interfaces, etc.)
- **How**: Gathered locally by the deployed binary
- **Cached**: No, gathered fresh for each execution
- **Purpose**: Support task conditionals and variable interpolation

This separation ensures:
1. Minimal SSH operations before compilation
2. No SSH fact gathering during execution
3. Binaries are self-sufficient with fact gathering capabilities
4. Architecture-specific optimizations during compilation

## Binary Deployment Deep Dive

### When Binary Deployment is Used

**Automatic Decision Criteria**:
1. **Task Count Threshold**: Groups of 5+ compatible tasks
2. **Network Operation Analysis**: High network overhead tasks
3. **Host Topology**: Multiple hosts with same task groups  
4. **Performance Modeling**: Predicted >2x speedup after compilation overhead

**Compatible Task Types**:
- File operations (copy, template, file module) - with asset bundling
- Package management (yum, apt, package)
- Service management (service, systemd)
- Shell commands (shell, command)
- User/group management

**Incompatible Tasks** (automatic SSH fallback):
- Interactive tasks (pause, prompt)
- Fetch operations (require controller write-back)
- delegate_to operations (see compatibility strategy below)
- Real-time operations requiring immediate feedback

### Binary Compilation Process

```rust
// 1. Task Analysis and Grouping
let task_groups = analyze_task_compatibility(tasks)?;
let deployment_groups = optimize_for_binary_deployment(task_groups)?;

// 2. Source Code Generation
for group in deployment_groups {
    let rust_source = generate_binary_template(&group)?;
    let embedded_data = embed_execution_data(&group)?;
    
    // 3. Cross-Compilation
    let binary = cross_compile_for_targets(&rust_source, &group.targets)?;
    
    // 4. Deployment
    deploy_binary_to_hosts(&binary, &group.hosts).await?;
}

// 5. Execution Coordination
let results = coordinate_binary_execution(&deployments).await?;
```

### Binary Architecture

**Target Binary Structure**:
```rust
// Generated binary contains:
- Embedded execution plan (JSON)
- Static linked Rust modules
- Embedded static files
- Runtime configuration
- Controller communication logic

// Execution flow:
1. Parse embedded execution plan
2. Collect runtime facts locally (if needed by tasks)
3. Execute tasks using statically linked modules
4. Report results back to controller
5. Cleanup and exit

// Note: Architecture/OS facts are determined at compile-time by rustle-facts
// Runtime facts (memory, disk, etc.) are gathered by the binary on the target
```

### File Operations and Asset Bundling Strategy

**Core Innovation**: All file operations are bundled with the binary at deployment time, eliminating network round-trips during execution.

**Asset Bundling Process**:
```rust
// During rustle-deploy phase
pub struct DeploymentBundle {
    binary: Vec<u8>,
    assets: HashMap<PathBuf, FileAsset>,
    total_size: u64,
}

pub struct FileAsset {
    content: Vec<u8>,
    mode: u32,
    owner: Option<String>,
    group: Option<String>,
    checksum: String,
}

// Asset collection during planning
pub fn collect_deployment_assets(tasks: &[Task]) -> Result<Vec<FileAsset>, DeployError> {
    let mut assets = Vec::new();
    
    for task in tasks {
        match task {
            Task::Copy { src, dest, mode, owner, group, .. } => {
                let content = std::fs::read(src)?;
                assets.push(FileAsset {
                    content,
                    mode: mode.unwrap_or(0o644),
                    owner: owner.clone(),
                    group: group.clone(),
                    checksum: calculate_sha256(&content),
                });
            }
            Task::Template { src, dest, vars, .. } => {
                // Templates are pre-rendered during compilation
                let rendered = render_template_at_compile_time(src, vars)?;
                assets.push(FileAsset {
                    content: rendered.into_bytes(),
                    ..Default::default()
                });
            }
            Task::Synchronize { src, dest, .. } => {
                // Rsync-style operations bundle entire directory trees
                let tree_assets = bundle_directory_tree(src, dest)?;
                assets.extend(tree_assets);
            }
            _ => {}
        }
    }
    
    Ok(assets)
}
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- **Single Deployment**: One transfer containing binary + all assets
- **Zero Runtime Network**: All files available locally on target
- **Atomic Operations**: Either all files deploy or none do
- **Compression**: Assets compressed during bundling
- **Deduplication**: Identical files shared across tasks

**Size Management**:
```rust
// Smart bundling decisions based on size
pub fn optimize_asset_bundling(assets: &[FileAsset]) -> BundlingStrategy {
    let total_size: u64 = assets.iter().map(|a| a.content.len() as u64).sum();
    
    match total_size {
        0..=50_000_000 => BundlingStrategy::EmbedAll,           // < 50MB: embed everything
        50_000_001..=200_000_000 => BundlingStrategy::Compress, // 50-200MB: aggressive compression
        _ => BundlingStrategy::StreamingDeploy,                 // > 200MB: stream assets separately
    }
}
```

### Delegate Pattern Compatibility Strategy

**Design Decision**: Rustle treats `delegate_to` as an anti-pattern that breaks performance optimization and encourages better playbook design.

**Compatibility Levels**:

1. **delegate_to: localhost** - Supported with Warning
   ```yaml
   # Discouraged pattern
   - name: Check API from controller
     uri: url=http://api.example.com
     delegate_to: localhost
     
   # Recommended alternative
   - name: Pre-flight checks
     hosts: localhost
     tasks:
       - uri: url=http://api.example.com
   ```

2. **delegate_to: other_host** - Not Supported in Binary Mode
   ```rust
   // In rustle-plan
   pub enum DelegateStrategy {
       WarnAndFallback,     // Log warning, use SSH execution
       ErrorAndHalt,        // Refuse to continue
       RefactoringSuggestion, // Provide migration guidance
   }
   
   pub fn handle_delegate_task(task: &Task) -> Result<ExecutionStrategy, PlanError> {
       match task {
           Task::DelegateTo { host: "localhost", .. } => {
               warn!("delegate_to: localhost is an anti-pattern. Task will execute via SSH.");
               Ok(ExecutionStrategy::SshOnly)
           }
           Task::DelegateTo { host, .. } => {
               Err(PlanError::UnsupportedPattern(
                   format!("delegate_to: {} not supported. Refactor into separate plays.", host)
               ))
           }
           _ => Ok(ExecutionStrategy::BinaryCapable)
       }
   }
   ```

**Migration Assistance**:
```bash
# Analyze playbook for anti-patterns
$ rustle analyze-compatibility playbook.yml

⚠️  3 instances of delegate_to: localhost found
   Line 42: API health check - Move to pre-flight play
   Line 73: Generate local report - Use local_action instead
   Line 91: Update inventory - Consider separate controller play

❌ 1 instance of delegate_to: other_host found
   Line 105: Cross-host coordination - Refactor using host groups

Suggested refactoring available: rustle refactor --fix-delegates playbook.yml
```

### Implementation Details

**Binary Structure with Assets**:
```rust
// Generated binary layout
pub struct TargetBinary {
    // Header
    magic: [u8; 8],          // "RUSTLE01"
    version: u32,
    asset_table_offset: u64,
    asset_count: u32,
    
    // Executable code
    executor: Vec<u8>,
    
    // Asset table
    assets: Vec<AssetEntry>,
    
    // Asset data (compressed)
    asset_data: Vec<u8>,
}

// Runtime asset extraction
impl TargetBinary {
    pub fn extract_assets(&self) -> Result<(), ExtractError> {
        for asset in &self.assets {
            let data = self.decompress_asset(asset)?;
            
            // Atomic file creation
            let temp_path = format!("{}.tmp", asset.path);
            std::fs::write(&temp_path, &data)?;
            
            // Set permissions
            set_file_permissions(&temp_path, asset.mode)?;
            set_file_ownership(&temp_path, &asset.owner, &asset.group)?;
            
            // Atomic rename
            std::fs::rename(&temp_path, &asset.path)?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

**Execution Flow with Assets**:
```rust
// 1. Binary startup
let binary = TargetBinary::load_self()?;

// 2. Extract all bundled assets
binary.extract_assets()?;

// 3. Execute tasks (all files already local)
for task in binary.execution_plan.tasks {
    match task {
        Task::Copy { src, dest, .. } => {
            // File already extracted to dest, just verify
            verify_file_integrity(dest)?;
        }
        Task::Template { dest, .. } => {
            // Template already rendered and extracted
            verify_file_integrity(dest)?;
        }
        _ => execute_task(task)?,
    }
}

// 4. Cleanup if requested
if binary.config.cleanup_on_exit {
    binary.cleanup_extracted_assets()?;
}

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Multi-Level Fallback Strategy

```rust
// 1. Binary Execution with SSH Fallback
match execute_binary_deployment(&deployment).await {
    Ok(results) => results,
    Err(BinaryError::DeploymentFailed) => {
        warn!("Binary deployment failed, falling back to SSH");
        execute_ssh_fallback(&tasks, &hosts).await?
    }
    Err(BinaryError::ExecutionTimeout) => {
        warn!("Binary execution timeout, terminating and falling back");
        terminate_binary_execution(&deployment).await?;
        execute_ssh_fallback(&tasks, &hosts).await?
    }
}

// 2. Connection Resilience
if connection_health_check(&host).is_err() {
    reconnect_with_backoff(&host).await?;
}

// 3. Compilation Fallback
if cross_compilation_fails(&target) {
    disable_binary_for_target(&target);
    continue_with_ssh_only(&tasks)?;
}
```

### Error Recovery Patterns

1. **Compilation Failures**: Automatic fallback to SSH execution
2. **Deployment Failures**: Retry with connection recovery, then SSH fallback
3. **Binary Execution Failures**: Terminate binary, collect partial results, SSH fallback
4. **Network Partitions**: Continue with available hosts, report unreachable
5. **Resource Exhaustion**: Graceful degradation with smaller batch sizes

## Security Considerations

### Binary Deployment Security

**Compilation Security**:
- Source code generation uses safe templates
- No user input directly embedded in generated code
- Static analysis of generated Rust code
- Sandboxed compilation environment

**Deployment Security**:
- Cryptographic binary verification (SHA-256)
- Secure transport over SSH
- Binary execution in controlled environment
- Automatic cleanup of deployed binaries

**Execution Security**:
- Same privilege model as SSH execution
- No privilege escalation beyond SSH user
- Binary communicates only with authorized controller
- Execution timeout and resource limits

### Secrets Management Integration

```rust
// Vault integration in binary deployment
let secrets = rustle_vault::decrypt_for_binary(
    &vault_identities,
    &required_secrets
)?;

// Embed encrypted secrets in binary
let embedded_secrets = encrypt_for_target(&secrets, &target_key)?;

// Runtime decryption on target
let runtime_secrets = decrypt_embedded_secrets(&embedded_secrets)?;
```
